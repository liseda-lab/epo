Epidemiology Ontology

EPO [1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2041-1480-5-4) is an ontology that describes epidemiologically relevant concepts not well covered elsewhere. In conjunction with NERO [2](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-897/session1-paper02.pdf) , it aims at supporting the precise and comprehensive semantic annotation of epidemiology resources, such as documents, datasets, models and simulations. EPO aims at filling the gap of epidemiologically-specific terms that are missing from other ontologies, and consequently reuses many terms from OBO Foundry ontologies, such as IDO and TRANS.

This ontology is no longer maintained.
